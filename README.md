## 📌 Privacy
IPTV M3U Editor works locally in your browser. Your playlist is not sent to a server.

## 📌 Notes About Status Checking
Browser-based checking has limits. Some IPTV servers block browser status checks with CORS. When that happens, the app shows `CORS` instead of guessing whether the stream is alive or dead.
